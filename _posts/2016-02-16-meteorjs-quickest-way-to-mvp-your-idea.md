This is the era of entrepreneurs and startups. With the launch of #StartUpIndia #StandUpIndia policies by 
PM Modi, now India is more friendly for start-ups. Not only Gov policies, even technology made so easy 
to execute your ideas. Cheaper and easy access to technologies made it possible to dream big and execute 
your idea.

The success rate of start-ups is significantly low and I believe this is what makes this world so exciting. 
We have started embracing failures, it is not like we should fail in implementing / executing our idea. 
But we should not be afraid of failures in the path.

How to get our idea turn into successful product / organisation? It all start with **_prototyping_** your idea 
or creating a **_MVP (Minimum Viable Product)_**. Either your idea is related to software world or not but you 
need a software system to showcase your prototype / MVP.

Now you get me where I am heading to… <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a> is the framework for you to quickly develop your idea and 
showcase to the world. To use Meteor all you need to know JavaScript , HTML & CSS. These technologies 
are the most used in the IT industry so it won’t be difficult either learn or get developers.

Meteor is easy to learn and get started. Once you are familiar with Meteor ecosystem then it is just 
matter of few weeks to get you MVP ready.

Recently I have presented the journey of one’s idea till execution in one of the meet-ups. It’s great talk on developing and showcasing your idea.
