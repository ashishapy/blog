	     <p>Microservices are slowly becoming the preferred way to build big, easy to maintain and highly scalable systems thanks to tools like <strong>Docker</strong>, CoreOS, etcd, Consul, Fleet, Mesos, Rocket, and others. Due to the goals today’s competition sets in front of us (flexibility, speed, and so on), microservices are probably the best type of architecture we can apply.</p>

<p>It’s a quest to deploy <strong>often and fast</strong>, be <strong>fully automatic</strong>, accomplish <strong>zero-downtime</strong>, have the <strong>ability to rollback</strong>, provide constant <strong>reliability</strong> across environments, be able to <strong>scale effortlessly</strong>, and create <strong>self-healing systems</strong> able to recuperate from failures.</p>

<p>Before containers became common, microservices were painful to deploy. On the other hand, monolithic applications are relatively simple to handle.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a></strong> made it possible to work with containers without suffering in the process. They made containers accessible and easy to use to everyone.</p>

<p>Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardised unit for software development, code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything you can install on a server. By encapsulating and isolating everything in a container, this guarantees that the container will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.</p>

<p>One can have DevOps Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD) and leverage Docker ecosystem to deliver <strong>often and fast</strong>, be <strong>fully automatic</strong>, accomplish <strong>zero-downtime</strong>, have the <strong>ability to rollback</strong> software products.</p>

<p>I had organised a meet up event for learning ‘Docker with DevOps - One step towards Microservices’ with hands-on. It was great success in terms of learning and having intellectual discussion around Docker, DevOps and Microservices.</p>

<p>Slides and Youtube recording are below:</p>

<p>If you interested to explore about Microservices, check book “Building Microservices” by ‘Sam Newman’. Also check <a href="https://leanpub.com/the-devops-2-toolkit">the-devops-2-toolkit</a> for DevOps and tool kits.</p>

<p>Hope this will help you to have intellectual discussion around Microservices architecture. You can always reach me on my Twitter account or email me.</p>

	     <p>I have been hearing about DevOps a lot and I thought to check it out, what is this new bird. I am tempted to try out at least one tool in each of its categories. If you like it, do leave your comment.</p>

<p>==If you are interested only in list of DevOps Tools then jump to <a href="#automate">Step 2: Automate</a> of the post.==</p>

<p>First question was in my mind. <strong>What is DevOps?</strong></p>

<p>DevOps (Development and Operations) is software development method, an improvement upon Agile and Lean.</p>

<p>Ok, we know the definition now. <strong>Why do we bother to learn another software development method?</strong></p>

<p>It’s just a name ‘DevOps’. If you already have</p>

<ul>
  <li>Great culture (transparency, collaboration, shared responsibilities and  free flow of knowledge) with in team and across teams.</li>
  <li>Most of the task are automated</li>
  <li>Great Monitoring to give instant feedback</li>
  <li>Instant delivery of production ready softwares / Fast IT.</li>
  <li>Incremental value addition to business</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you are already on DevOps and please educate others to be awesome, as you are.</p>

<p>Hummm… <strong>I am not on DevOps.</strong>
Okay, let’s make transition to DevOps. 
I must warn you!!! Once you make transition to DevOps then there is no turning back. It’s like full HD TV, once you experienced it, you never wanna go back to standard TV :) .</p>

<p>Transition to DevOps is <strong>simple two step process</strong>.</p>

<p>Step 1: Re-org with cultural changes
Step 2: Automate</p>

<p>Thank you!!!</p>

<p>Still reading? DevOps must has got your attention ;) 
Ok, ok, without wasting any more time, we jump to two step process.</p>

<p>Step 1: <strong>Re-org with cultural changes</strong>
DevOps is not about hiring new people but it is re-org of your existing team with cultural changes.</p>

<p>You might have organisation structure as below, divided by their roles and skills.</p>

<p><img src="//cdn.ashishapy.com/2015/Jun/1do-1434693207495.jpg" alt="Typical organisation structure" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Re-org to have every stakeholder a common Goal, shared vision. Get a clear vision and have team around services. You maintain services over decades, not a project. Ultimately goal of project is also a service.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="//cdn.ashishapy.com/2015/Jun/2do-1434695018246.jpg" alt="team around services" /></p>

<p>Address wastes &amp; objections within team and encourage to have a shared vision.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Eliminate wastes like knowledge waste, waiting waste, waste in motion and inventory waste.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Address objections like security, compliance, offshore team, legacy and skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bring transparency within the team and let free flow of knowledge at every level.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What about automation?</strong> do automation will help in building a DevOps team &amp; cultural changes?</p>

<p>==<span id="automate">Step 2: <strong>Automate</strong></span>==</p>

<p>Yes, tools are integral part of DevOps. Tools help to automate things and bring DevOps culture in the team.</p>
